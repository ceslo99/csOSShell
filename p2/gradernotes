I wrote this code myself and has no bugs

Dealt with the parse first since felt like a good place to start. Handled
all the errors in there first and gradually added more conditions.

For the bang bang, I was able to get the previous command to work.
Used afor loop and went through myargv and kept saving it as soon 
as it finished inparse. If found !! in oarse, then it would ignore
the rest of the words and before returning, put olldmyargv into
myargv. will be using Memset later since it's one line of code.
current code will not work for more than one previous. Will need
to adjust code for that in following projects.
